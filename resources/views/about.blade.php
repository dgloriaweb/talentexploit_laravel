<h1>
About the site and me</h1>

<p>The site was built in Laravel7, using VS Code, XAMPP service. </p>
<p>The goal is to provide a tool for any individual who are stuck in their career to better understand themselves as skilled people, and discover the hidden callings and opportunities based on their past and present skills.</p>
<p>The results are counted by calculating a match to the stored jobs based on the user settings.</p>
<p>I have planned the application for years and the first version was created in CodeIgniter in 2019. </p>
<p>The current version is under construction.</p>
